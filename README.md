# US_Terrorism
Examining the US Terrorism Data from the Global Terrorism Database from 1970-2016. This is for my final project at GA. 

This will be looking primarily at trends within the the US states, target locations of attacks and weapons of choice for these terrorist attacks. We will also be examining the success/failure based on these factors.
